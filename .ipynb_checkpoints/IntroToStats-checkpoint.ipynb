    "Meet Sally, a public school administrator. Some schools in her state of Tennessee are performing below average academically. Her superintendent, under pressure from frustrated parents and voters, approached Sally with the task of understanding why these schools are under-performing. Not an easy problem, to be sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve school performance, Sally needs to learn more about these schools and their students, just as a business needs to understand its own strengths and weaknesses and its customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Sally is eager to build an impressive explanatory model, she knows the importance of conducting preliminary research to prevent possible pitfalls or blind spots (e.g. cognitive bias'). Thus, she engages in a thorough exploratory analysis, which includes: a lit review, data collection, descriptive and inferential statistics, and data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "First Sally imports the libries she will use with alias and sets her plot style and font size and creates a data frame with her data."
